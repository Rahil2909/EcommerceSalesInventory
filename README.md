# E-Commerce Sales and Inventory Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000+ e-commerce transactions and inventory levels to identify sales trends, revenue patterns, and stock shortages across regions. It demonstrates skills in data engineering, SQL querying, and visualization using Tableau or Power BI.

## Overview
- **Dataset**: `processed_ecommerce_data.csv` contains fields like `OrderID`, `OrderDate`, `Product`, `Category`, `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, `Region`, `StockLevel`, `TotalSales`, and `LowStock`.
- **Tools Used**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SQLite), SQL, Tableau/Power BI.
- **Visualizations**: Includes Revenue by Product, LowStock by Region, and Sales Trend over time.



## Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**: Install via Anaconda or Python.org.
- **Libraries**: Install required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas numpy sqlite3
(Note: sqlite3 is built into Python, so no separate installation is needed.)

Tableau Public or Power BI Desktop: Download for free from tableau.com or powerbi.microsoft.com.
